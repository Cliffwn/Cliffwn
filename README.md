- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cliff
- 
- Iâ€™m interested in big piles of data and how we can pull knowledge from it.
- Iâ€™m currently learning python and Jupyter specifically as I really like the way it shows information.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects helping scientists process their data.
- I'm accessible by email at Cliffwn@gmail.com.
